## üöÄ **Next Steps: New Features**

### üïπÔ∏è **Fast Mode**
If players want a faster experience without interruptions between rounds, you can implement a **"Fast Mode"**. In this mode, matchups and dice rolls are done automatically without the need for player intervention between rounds.

**How would it work?**
- **Automatic Matchmaking**: The system automatically pairs up players for the rounds without the user having to click a button.
- **Automatic Rolls**: Dice rolls are performed instantly, without waiting for players to roll manually.
- **Automatic Advancements**: After each round, the player who wins advances to the next round without confirmation.

This mode will allow players to enjoy faster rounds and continue with the tournament without interruptions.

**Potential Benefits**:
- **Faster gameplay**.
- **Less intervention**: Ideal for those who prefer to play without manual interaction between each round.
- **Fluid gameplay**: Perfect for shorter sessions or when players want to experience multiple tournaments quickly.

### üèÜ **Leaderboard or Final Ranking Table**
To enhance competition and motivation, you can add a **leaderboard** that shows the **highest scores** from all the tournaments played. This will allow players to see their performance over time and compare themselves with other participants.

**Leaderboard Features**:
- **Global Ranking**: A general ranking with the highest scores from all players across all tournaments.
- **Tournament-Specific Ranking**: A table that shows how players performed in each individual tournament, allowing them to see their rank in specific events.
- **Score Details**: The leaderboard should include the player‚Äôs name, the score obtained, and their position in the ranking.
- **Automatic Updates**: After each tournament, the leaderboard updates automatically to reflect the most recent player scores.

**Benefits of the Leaderboard**:
- **Encourages competition**: Players will want to improve their scores and climb the ranking.
- **Additional motivation**: Players are incentivized to participate in more tournaments to improve their position on the table.
- **Progress tracking**: Players can track their performance over several tournaments.

**How to Implement?**
- You could store player scores and rankings in a local file or a database (if you decide to make it online) to persist data between game sessions.
- Display the leaderboard at the end of the game or in a dedicated section of the website or app.

### üí¨ **Feedback Messages During the Game**
Throughout the game, it's essential to provide **interactive feedback messages** that guide players through the entire process, from matchmaking to the end of the tournament. We use **SweetAlert** to show interactive and engaging alerts that enhance the user experience and keep the game smooth.

### üì¢ **Keep in mind that these steps are optional, but adding them will increase interactivity and competition in the game.**
